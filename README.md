**You Don't have to wait for the faculty !!** 
**Instead**, my Chrome extension will wait for the faculty and will notify you at once the faculty arrives.

*  click Start. Now just wait or go to another tab, do your stuff, or watch a movie from your computer, do whatever you want to do, just do not close the meeting tab.
* The extension automatically reloads the meeting tab every in 10 seconds. Once the faculty arrives, it stops reloading and sends you a notification through Chrome.
